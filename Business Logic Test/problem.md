#### Scenario: Company Clone Chaos

In our CRM (e.g., HubSpot or Salesforce), we often find duplicate company records. These clones have:

- Slightly different names or domains (e.g. acme.com, acme.io, acme-industries.com)

- Different associated records (some with valuable deals, others with key contacts)

- Conflicting or partial property values (e.g. industry, lifecycle stage, region)

- Disjointed activity logs and scoring

- Think of the consequences of your solutions

The team needs to solve this
